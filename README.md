# makepad-7guis
Building the 7 GUIS with Rust Makepad UI framework

This is an attempt to build some simple programs using the [Makepad Framework](https://github.com/makepad/makepad/)

It follows the [7 GUIs model](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/) to create simple to moderate UI applications

As Makepad is in active development, some features may not be available and full UI support may not be complete. We will work around any issues we may find.
